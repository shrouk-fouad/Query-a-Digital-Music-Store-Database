## Overview
In the Project we will be using a new data set. It will be a music store. However, as one final preparation, below is a fully completed project that uses the Parch and Posey Data you have been using. Hopefully, it will be an example you can use to guide your work in the project.

### Question 1 : What are the popularity percentages of different music genres?
#### Findings 
There are four popular music genres : rock, metal, Latin and alternative & punk represent 37.28%, 17.23%, 11.79 %, and 10.89% popularity respectively.

### Question 2 :  Does the popularity of music genres have an influence on earnings? 
#### Findings 
This graph clearly shows that the percentages of total earnings for most of the music genres are very close to their popularity percentages, so genre popularity can have an influence on earnings.

### Question 3 : Who are the top 5 most popular artists?
#### Findings 
This graph displays the top 5 most popular artists and the number of customers for every one of them. A total of 29 people purchased albums from U2, 28 purchased albums from Led Zeppelin, 27 purchased albums from both of Metallica and Iron Maiden, and 16 purchased albums from Os Paralamas Do Sucesso.

### Question 4 : Does the popularity of artists influence their earnings?
#### Findings 
This graph indicates that just a few artists have a positive correlation between their numbers of popularity and total earnings such as Iron Maiden and Lost, however most of the artists don’t have this correlation, hence popularity doesn’t play a significant role in increasing earnings from this music store.
